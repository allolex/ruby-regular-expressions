# We are also wrapping the base pattern in parentheses to capture it when
# it does match.

# String#scan
# It returns a list of matches, each match in its own array when you have
# capture groups in your pattern. That's why we need to flatten the array
# below.
#
# A couple of methods for some nice formatting:
#
# This one puts single quotes around each item in a list. It's not very
# clever.
#
def add_quotes(list)
  list.map { |item| "'#{item}'" }
end

# This one prepends 'and' on the final list element, e.g. '1, 2, 3' becomes '1,
# 2, and 3'.
#
def list_in_english(list)
  list.last.gsub!(/\A/) { 'and ' }
  list
end

# Capture *all* matches
#

# Print out the formatted capture list

# Often you will want to do more than just check to see whether a pattern match
# is found in a given textâ€”you'll want to manipulate the text itself. Capturing
# all of or parts of your pattern can be very useful in accomplishing this.
